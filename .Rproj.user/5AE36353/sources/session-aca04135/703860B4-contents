# Motivation

*While working on the new group coordinator backing KIP-848, we found out about the `offsets.commit.required.acks`
config. Its documentation says that its default value (-1) should never
be overridden. It is also worth mentioning that whenever set to
something different than -1, the current implementation does not respect
the semantic of high watermark, like a regular consumer does. So for
instance, if 1 is used, the coordinator writes to the leader and then
directly materialize the offset to the cache. We suppose that it was
implemented this way to ensure that the last received offsets are
directly available for next offset fetch requests. Note that this is
also wrongly used when writing group metadata (rebalance) to the log.
This guarantee provided by the non default configurations are weak and
inconsistent. As there are no known use cases where it should be, we propose to simply remove it.*

# Public Interfaces

None.

# Proposed Changes

-   Deprecate *`offsets.commit.required.acks`* in 3.8. As usually, the broker will log a warning if the configuration is used.

-   Remove *`offsets.commit.required.acks`* in 4.0.

# Compatibility, Deprecation, and Migration Plan

-   *If
    anyone uses this configuration, it would transparently moved to using
    the default (-1). As a side effect, we suppose that it could have a
    slightly impact on performance.*

# Rejected Alternatives

-   *The alternative would be to keep it.*
